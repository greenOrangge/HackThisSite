# Peace Poetry: HACKED

### So the website has been hacked and the owner has lost access, we need to regain access to it. 

- URL : <https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/>

- Let's view the page source.
- all the code is squeezed into 1 line making it hard for us to read/analyze.
- let's format properly using [HTML Formatter][https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html]
- we can see a comment stating `Note to the webmasterThis website has been hacked, but not totally destroyed. The old website is still up. I simply copied the old index.html file to oldindex.html and remade this one. Sorry about the inconvenience.`
- so all we have to do is go to exchange the `oldindex.html`  to the normal `index.html`
- here we find the original peace poetry page <https://www.hackthissite.org/missions/realistic/3/oldindex.html>

- now copy the code of `oldindex.html`
- go to the submit poetry page and give the name as `../index.html` and post the code in the below box and click submit.
#### DONE!
